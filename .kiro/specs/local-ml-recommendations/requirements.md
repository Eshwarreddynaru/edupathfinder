# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to implement local machine learning models to reduce dependency on the Google Gemini API for course recommendations. The system will use traditional ML algorithms and pre-trained models to provide intelligent, personalized course recommendations without requiring external API calls, making the system more reliable, faster, and cost-effective.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide personalized course recommendations using local ML models, so that I can get recommendations even when external APIs are unavailable or to reduce API costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates recommendations THEN it SHALL use local ML models as the primary recommendation engine
2. WHEN external API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to local ML models seamlessly
3. WHEN user profile data is provided THEN the local ML model SHALL generate at least 5 relevant course recommendations
4. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance score with confidence intervals

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the local ML system to learn from user interactions and preferences, so that recommendations improve over time without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with recommended courses THEN the system SHALL capture implicit feedback (clicks, time spent, etc.)
2. WHEN users provide explicit feedback THEN the system SHALL incorporate ratings and preferences into the model
3. WHEN sufficient interaction data exists THEN the system SHALL retrain models to improve accuracy
4. WHEN new user profiles are created THEN the system SHALL handle cold-start problems using content-based filtering

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use multiple ML approaches for robust recommendations, so that the system can handle different types of users and scenarios effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL implement content-based filtering using course features
2. WHEN user interaction data exists THEN the system SHALL implement collaborative filtering
3. WHEN combining approaches THEN the system SHALL use ensemble methods to merge different recommendation strategies
4. WHEN processing text data THEN the system SHALL use NLP techniques for semantic similarity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the local ML system to provide explainable recommendations, so that I understand why specific courses are suggested to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL provide explanation text for each recommendation
2. WHEN displaying courses THEN the system SHALL show similarity scores and matching criteria
3. WHEN user queries about recommendations THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning using interpretable features
4. WHEN multiple factors influence recommendations THEN the system SHALL show weighted contribution of each factor

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the local ML models to be efficient and scalable, so that the system performs well with growing user base and course catalog.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are loaded THEN they SHALL initialize within 5 seconds on standard hardware
2. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for up to 1000 courses
3. WHEN storing models THEN they SHALL use efficient serialization formats (pickle, joblib, or ONNX)
4. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement model compression techniques
